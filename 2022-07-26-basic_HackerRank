# Revising the Select Query 2
SELECT name
FROM city
WHERE countrycode = 'USA'
AND population >120000

# Weather Observation Station 5
SELECT city, LENGTH(city)
FROM station
ORDER BY LENGTH(city), city
LIMIT 1;

SELECT city, LENGTH(city)
FROM station
ORDER BY LENGTH(city) DESC, city
LIMIT 1;
## LENGTH 함수는 데이터의 길이를 확인할 때 사용, LEN()으로 시도했더니 오류
